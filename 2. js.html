        -----Key points to note-----

        What is a variable?
        Stored memory location.

        EXAMPLE OF VARIABLE:
        - var <name of variable> or
        - let <name of variable> or
        - const <name of variable>

            let a = 1; or const b = 1; or var c =1;

            DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VAR, LET  AND CONST

            - var and let does the same but let is the new version of var.
            - using let, you cannot redeclare a variable once assigned
            - const works the same way as var and let but const is used 
            to declare values that will never change


            RULES OF VARIABLE NAMING
            1. Should not contain spaces
                use camel case(techCamp) or snake case(tech_camp)
            2. Should not be a key word in javascript
             example (let var = 1;)

            3. Should not begin with a number but can have numbers
            eg let 1nub = 1;
            
            4. Should contain only letters, digits, or the symbols & and _

        const e = 1; //number
        const f = 'tech camp'; // string
        const bol = true; //boolean (true or false)
        
        const z = null //defines a null value

        const fname = 'Leon', lname = 'Wakoli', dob ='2020-10-10', pos = 'Ruaka';
